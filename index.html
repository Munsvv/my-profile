				<h1>About Sveva...</h1>

				<img src="images/profile pic.jpg"alt="Sveva Munari"class="profile">
				<p>
					Hi I'm Sveva and I am a student currently studying at <span class="bolded">ESSEC</span>. This is my profile I created while going through a course with Le Wagon on how to programme. I really enjoyed this course because I got to see my coding turn into a website. The subjects I'm genuinely passionate about and will talk about in this profile are <span class="bolded-and-underlined">art, cars and video games.</span>

				<h2>ART and DESIGN </h2>
				<img src="images/art.jpg"alt="ART"class="art">
				<p>
					Art ande design have been a passion f mine since I was young. Over the years I have become a lot more creative and better at the subject. Above is one of my paintings I did during my time doing <span class="bolded">A Level ART</span> in high school. I used many techniques such as ink and brush, spreading ink with water and also fine-liner. Some of my favorite artists and designers of all time are <span class="bolded">Goia, Dali and Iris Van Herpen.</span>

				<h2>CARS</h2>
				<p>
					Cars are a new interest of mine. I started appreciating <span class="bolded">sports cars</span>, and being interested in how they are built. Now I have moved onto being interested more into <span class="bolded">older cars and JDM's (Japanese Design Manufacture).</span> I have also joined an assocation about cars in ESSEC called <span class="bolded">GTE (Gran Turismo ESSEC)</span>. I am part of the events pole in this assocation. <span class="bolded-and-underlined">Below is the assocations Instagram!</span>

				<h2>VIDEO GAMES</h2>
				<p>
					I've always been very into video games. I started with playing wii games such as <span class="bolded">Super Mario Bros</span>. Then I played newer games such as <span class="bolded">RDR2</span> and <span class="bolded">COD:infinite warfare</span>. When I was around 15 I bought all the parts to a PC and built one myself which I'm currently still using today and using to code this profile. I play nowadays online FPS's and story games. One of my favorite story games is <span class="bolded">Horizon Zero Dawn</span> it has the most amazing design behind it and I won't ever be unimpressed by it. <span class="bolded-and-underlined">Below is my account for the clips I take while playing!</span>
